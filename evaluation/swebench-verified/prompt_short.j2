I've uploaded a python code repository in the directory {{ instance.repo_path }} (not in /tmp/inputs). Consider the following issue descriptions:

<issue_description>
{{ instance.problem_statement }}
</issue_description>

Can you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <issue_description> are met?
I've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <issue_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!
Also the development Python environment is already set up for you (i.e., all dependencies already installed), so you don't need to install other packages.

Your task is to make the minimal changes to non-test files in the {{ instance.repo_path }} directory to ensure the <issue_description> is satisfied.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.
2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the execute_bash tool to confirm the error
   - **Important:** If testing a Python package, add `import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '{{ instance.repo_path }}')` at the top of your script before package imports to ensure you're testing the local version, not an installed version.
3. Edit the source code of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!
5. Think about edge cases and make sure your fix handles them as well

Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long.
