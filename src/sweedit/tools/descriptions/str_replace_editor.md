Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files
* State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user
* If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep
* The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file
* Large file outputs will be truncated, showing only the first and last 250 lines

Notes for using the `str_replace` command:
* The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!
* If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique
* The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`
